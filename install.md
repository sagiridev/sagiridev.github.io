# Minimal Gridsome Starter with TailwindCSS + Markdown

This starter is very simple, it's just meant to skip the setup of Gridsome as a Static Site + CMS. It's using TailwindCSS, as well as Markdown for the site content. 

There are two example posts in the `content/posts` folder, a template for Blog Posts (as well as blog feed items), and some simple meta tag examples in the blog post template.
